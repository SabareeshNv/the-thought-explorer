Approval voting is a voting method in which voters are allowed to vote for as many candidates as they approve of. This method has been used in many multi-party democracies around the world, including India. The effectiveness of approval voting in such a complex and diverse political landscape can be evaluated by analyzing the outcome of recent elections in India.

The 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections in India provide a useful lens to evaluate the effectiveness of approval voting. In the 2014 election, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won a historic majority, securing 282 of the 543 seats in the lower house of Parliament. On the other hand, the 2019 election resulted in a re-election of the BJP, with the party winning 303 seats, increasing its majority in the Lok Sabha.

While the BJP has been the dominant party in Indian politics in recent years, smaller and regional parties have played a significant role in shaping the political landscape. Approval voting, with its ability to allow voters to express their support for multiple parties, could have potentially helped such smaller parties make a meaningful election run.

One example of a smaller party that could have benefited from approval voting is the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which emerged as a major political force in the 2014 election, winning four seats in the Delhi region. However, despite its strong showing, the AAP was unable to expand its reach beyond Delhi in the 2014 election.

In the 2019 election, the AAP contested in the Delhi region but failed to win a single seat, despite garnering a substantial vote share. The lack of representation for the AAP in the Lok Sabha can be attributed to the first-past-the-post system, in which the candidate with the most votes wins, even if they don’t have a majority. This system often results in wasted votes for parties that do not win a seat, as their voters’ preferences are not taken into account.

In a scenario where approval voting was used, voters could have expressed their support for both the BJP and the AAP. This would have given the AAP a chance to secure seats in the Lok Sabha, even if it did not win the majority of votes in any given constituency. In this scenario, the AAP could have used its representation in the Lok Sabha to build a stronger national presence and appeal to a wider range of voters.

| INC       | 15       | 37.5           |


In conclusion, approval voting has the potential to be an effective voting method in a multi-party democracy like India. By allowing voters to express their support for multiple parties, it can help smaller parties make a meaningful election run and increase the representation of diverse political views in the national legislature. The outcome of the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections suggest that approval voting could have provided a path for an underdog political party, like the AAP, to have made a stronger election run and secure representation in the Parliament.
